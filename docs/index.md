## Introduction

The NFDI4Memory (MEMO) Knowledge Graph (KG) functions as an index to aggregate the diverse, heterogeneous data resources available in the area of historical sciences.
With the KG, which provides relevant metadata about data providers, services, and resources in a structured and interlinked form, it becomes possible to execute federated queries over multiple portals.
In the current version, we integrated a set of exemplary metadata about data portals, services, and related concepts for a first prototype.
It is possible to search for categories such as data portals, academic disciplines, purposes, or technological means.
