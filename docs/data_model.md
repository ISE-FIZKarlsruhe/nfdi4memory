## Data Model

The ontology behind the MEMO knowledge graph is a modular extension to the NFDICore ontology. To distinguish between data providers, services,
and the actual research data they ingest into the KG, the module is divided into a layer for Research Information (the Research Information Graph (RIG),
and for Research Data (the Research Data Graph (RDG)).
A dedicated documentation can be found under the [Ontology](ontology.md) tab.
